> You probably came here from [README.md](https://github.com/bensyxx/cdn/blob/main/README.md), so here are the rules.

- **Don't upload horrible things.** Seriously, what's wrong with you?
- **Make sure you keep your files to yourself!** Find your folder where you are uploading your files. If you don't have one, create one using these naming conventions:

  - Use your GitHub username. Your file path should be: /c/FILETYPE/octocat, replace FILETYPE with one of the categories in the [c folder](https://github.com/bensyxx/cdn/c](https://github.com/bensyxx/cdn/tree/main/c).

- **Just upload it.** Don't start Issues on here, there is no code that is meant to be ran inside GitHub. If code is uploaded, it isn't meant to run on GitHub (most of the time)!

> If you follow these, you can upload whatever you want. Bye!
