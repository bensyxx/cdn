This is my public CDN repo for just uploading my stuff. You can upload literally anything GitHub supports, here's how:

- **Add a seperate branch** and upload your file in the folder matching it, or if any of them don't match with whatever you are uploading, just create a new folder.
- **Find your folder**. This is your GitHub username, it's required or it get's deleted.
- **Upload your file**. Simple as that. Save it in your folder.
- **Now get the link!** You can use the raw code straight off of GitHub for code, or if it's an image, add the filepath after **cwh.bensyxx.dev**. It will look something like this:

```
https://cwh.bensyxx.dev/c/images/octocat/cutedolphin.png
```

> You can use cwh.bensyxx.dev/c/ for raw code too! Just remember if you take raw code from GitHub, add ?raw=true to the link.

That's about all this is. If I ever learn how to just upload it from a site, I will.
